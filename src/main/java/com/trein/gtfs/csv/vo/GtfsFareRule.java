/**
 * Rules for applying fare information for a transit organization's routes.<br>
 * <br>
 * The fare_rules table allows you to specify how fares in fare_attributes.txt apply to an
 * itinerary. Most fare structures use some combination of the following rules:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <li>Fare depends on origin or destination stations.</li>
 * <li>Fare depends on which zones the itinerary passes through.</li>
 * <li>Fare depends on which route the itinerary uses.</li>
 * </pre>
 *
 * For examples that demonstrate how to specify a fare structure with fare_rules.txt and
 * fare_attributes.txt, see FareExamples in the GoogleTransitDataFeed open source project wiki.

     * through zones 5 and 6 but not zone 7 would not have fare class "c". For more detail, see
